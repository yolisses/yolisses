### Yo, sup? 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm a full stack developer.
  
- 🎵 I'm currently working in a (overengineered) music AI.
- 👥 If you're doing music or AI too, [__CALL ME__](https://api.whatsapp.com/send/?phone=558393450389&text=Hello,%20I%20saw%20your%20github%20profile&type=phone_number&app_absent=0).  
We can be like Jobs & Wozniak, Gates & Allen, or Page & Brin. 

- 🏗 I want to build a lot of valuable things.
- 👨‍🔬 I love to learn basically anything labored with the scientific method.


Fun facts: 
- At the time I'm writing, I have more commits here in the last year than [Linus Torvalds](https://github.com/torvalds).
- My ultimate goal is to bring virtually infinite power to humanity by creating general-purpose self-replicating robots.
