### Hello, World! 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm a full stack developer.
- 🏗 I want to build a lot of valuable things.
- 👨‍🔬 I love to learn basically anything labored with the scientific method.

I also have a [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/yolisses) and a [Secondary GitHub](https://github.com/yolisses0)

Fun facts: 
- aɪ laɪk ðə ˈʧælənʤ ʌv ˈrɛdɪŋ frʌm aɪ pi eɪ.
